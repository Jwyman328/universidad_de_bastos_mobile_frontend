- development time is super important, 
- tiger tank vs. sherman tank 
    - yes tiger tank is better but it takes 30 times longer to build on 
        and it is only 5 times better. so in the end it is a worse investment 
- react native fast refresh allows you to see your development changes faster.

SHERMAN TANKS WERE EASIER TO FIX 
    - sherman tanks were much simpler this means that they could fix them easier.
    - shermans had supporting tools that made it easy to swap out parts

FLIPPER 
    - mobile engineers at fb use it.

    - you have your device connections to the simulator or emulator 
    - as well you have connection to the metro bundler (React native)

    - originally built for native development so it can look for underlining native application
    - in the layout extension you can look at the native elements taht are used to create the UI application
    - you can inspectthe network requests too which are a native feature.

    - preferences extension you can set the application preferences, 
        - langueage 

Using Flipper to analysis the application 
    - FLIPPER LOGS 
    - if you do a console .log the flipper logs are way better and superflexible. you can filter values.
    -  you can  filter by error, or debugs, or some value 


HERMES DEBUGGER 
    - must use Android and using android is ideal because the hermes is the actual js engine that android uses.
    - https://reactnative.dev/docs/hermes

    project.ext.react = [
    enableHermes: true,  // clean and rebuild if changing
]
