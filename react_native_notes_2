react_native_notes_2
 

 - you can not put text in a view 
 - the views main job is to apply styles and do layouting

 - like react must have a parent component like a view.

 only about tne core components
 - react native buttons are self closing with a title property 
 <Button title='hello world'/>

 react native is all about compoennts and then adding the right structure to the components 

 - react components take arguments with curls brackets 

 <View something={'something'}> 
 // if you wnat to pass in styles each component has a style parameter 

 <View style={{my style go here, padding:30}}> 
 - the styles parameters takes a styles object which you cna put your css like styles 
 - this is considered na inline style
 -all multie word style properties are camel case like borderColor:'red'

 - each component will have a huge list of props you can set on it 



LAYOUT style    
- must use flexbox 
- things are set by default to use flexbox and use column setting


navigation 
- set up an outer navigation shell like in react. 
- each component that is defined as a screen gets a navigation object passed to it 
    - this navigation object is used to navigate to other screens.
    - you should descrture this navigation object in the props with {{navigation}}
- the navigation uses the Animated library



STARTING APP 
- you need to start up the server with npm start 

- you must start the simulator with a different command


SCROLLVIEW
    - without scroll view we can not scroll to anything that is hidden off the page.
    - must be a bounded height in order to work
    - the children have unbounded height so the scroll view must have bounded height
    - should pass down flex:1 ? 
also could use FlatList,
    - flatlist will only render the elemetns that show on the page where as 
    scrolllview will render everything on the page when the page laods.
    - use contentContainerStyle to style a scrollview 
    - use flexgrow:1 if you want to be able to scroll and have it lock 
    when you scrll down on components
    - so on the scrollview you must use two different style properties one for setting styles 
    and one for setting the layout the styles are the regular style prop 
    and the layout of the elements insde of it is the contentContainerStyle


SafeAreaView?? waht is it 
    - since ios adds this navigation header, you must add this 
    if tou want to automaticallt respond to the header padding 
    instead of manually having to make components have a margin 
    or padding to that autoehader added for navigation


Button!
    - you can barly add styles to a traditional button
    - cant even add a padding so must do a wrapper over it 

seems like a lot of styling problems come from the % based styling i like to do
- never assign a width and a height and jsut use flex box for positions
- as well just use paddings and margins when you ahve no choice 


FLEXBOX REVIEW 
    - fr means free space so it says if there is any free space remaining put it in this component?
    - flexbox by default sets everythign to only as wide and tall as it needs to be when the 
        outer container width and height is not set.
    - if you set the width and height of the parent then the children will expand ot the height of the parent 
    if it is a row, or expand to the width of the parent if it is a column
        - aka they stretch across the cross axis
        - aka align items is stretch by default
        - stretch tells the child how much space to take 
            - where as all other align-items do not
    - space evenly etc. will take the remaining space and distribute it between the items, 
    aka set auto margins
    - flex:1, this means give me 100% of the main axis space and put it in my component, expand my component 
        by that amount of space
    - use flex and pixels so spacing and widths and heights


NAVIGATION 
    - i want to access navigation from any screen so there is a useNavigation hook
    - https://reactnavigation.org/docs/connecting-navigation-prop/
    - alternatively you could use the context api, and put the naviation there  
        but the useNAvigation hook will basically do that for oyu


DYNAMIC VAIRABLES in STYLE SHEET?
    - you must create a function that takes in an argument that 
        you want to set to a style parameter and then you set it and return the stylesheet object 
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42707327/passing-props-into-external-stylesheet-in-react-native


USEEFFECT STACK OVERFLOW 
    - if you set a state in useEffect aka you only want it to run once 
    remember to set an empty array to the useEffect so it only runs once.

REGONAL STYLES / GLOBAL 
    - you can make a stylesheet variable and save it anywhere and then export it and 
        import it like any other object/variable


HADNLING STATE WITH HTTP REQUESTS ? 
    - hooks 
    https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html
    what are hooks? they let you hook into life cycle and state features 
    of a class based component.
    - useEffect hook is used for all start, did update, did close lifecycles.
    - effect hook as access to the latest state of the component.
    - useEffect hook may also specify how to clean up a component
    - a return statement in a useEffect hook will produce a clean up and 
    will not run the function returned from a useEffect hook untill after the component is torn down

    RULES 
        - hooks can not be called inside loops or anything nested 
            they must only be called at the top level of a component


    CUSTOM HOOKS ?
        - custom hooks allow you to customize the interactions between state hooks 
            inside other components while allowing that customization to be utilized in other areas 
           . it is a way to reuse stateful logic but not reuse the same state.
           if you want to reuse the same state it would need to be accessed from inside that hook 
           and set to that custom hooks state. for example like a redux call 
           that sets that hooks state and then provides actions on it.
        - each call to a hook has completley isolated state just like when we use useState,
        useState creates a brand new state object and state changing function, 
        so a custom hook just allows you to modify what you passBack like passing back a function
        to change the state in some unique way, or some type of action that takes place on the 
        data at the beggining of the initializtion or the closign of the component.


useReducer 



useContext 
    - add state and the functions that change that state and consume said state and functions 
        at any level in a tree  
    - using context makes re-using a component difficult. 
        re-used components should more so be using props to get there data but this makes sense 
        an outer component that wont be re-used could use the context api to get the data and then 
        pass it into the component.
    - context takes a default value which when no value is passed into the context api 
        it will use that default value
    - DYNAMIC CONTEXT 
        - so i can consume context but how do i change it in other places?
            - the value you pass in must be from a useState or some type of state hook 
                and then you must pass in the function that changes it. 
    - i was looking at the conte¸¸¸xt api instead of the useContext hook 




API NOTES 
    - react native deals with errors differently because its possible a response in html is sent back 
    and .json wonr handle it 
    - you have to stringify your http requests you cant sned javascript objects,
        everything must be in a string like this {"username":"guestUser@gmail.com" , "password": "test123!123"}


MOVING TO TYPESCRIPT NOTES 
    - all ts files actually have to be tsx files in react if you want to use typescript.


useReducer
    - useReducer is prefereable to useState when you have complex state or when 
        one state relies on another state 
    - also you can pass dispatch down to components allowing them to manipulate state 
        from below where they are initiated, you could do this with passing hte useState 
        changing function but you would have to pass down multiple if you needed to change multiple.

    const [value,dispatch] = useReducer(myReducerSwitchFunction, initialValue);


    reducerFunction(state,action){
        case(action.type){
            case ('')
        }
    }
